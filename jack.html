					<h1 class="center">Clearing Up Some Misinformation Concerning Mad Jack</h1>
					<div class="divide"></div>
					<p>Lt. Col. John Malcolm Fleming Thorpe Churchill is a man surrounded by misinformation, rumors, and exaggeration. This really bothers me, so I'm gonna try to list some of the misconceptions I've heard and give proof of them being wrong.</p>

					<h2 class="center">Mad Jack Carried a Claymore</h2>
					<p>This is obviously the most common rumor you hear, and is in fact not wrong, it it correct. <em>*However*</em>, it is an exaggeration through abiguity. You must understand that "claymore" is not a specific sword, it is in fact two different swords that go by the same name. The most well known claymore is the greatsword, usually at least as tall as its weilder, and usually bearing a V-shaped crossguard. The other claymore is a sidesword, bearing a one handed basket hilt, with a blade not longer than two feet usually. The basket hilted claymore can also be called a claybeg or a backsword. This is the sort of claymore Mad Jack carried. Look at this image:</p>
					<img src="/images/sword.jpg" class="center" style="width:60%">
					<p>If you look to the right of the image, you can see a soldier carrying in his right hand an object that looks like a white wedge. That object is a basket hilted claymore, that soldier is Jack Churchill, and that photo was taken in 1940, when the Fighting Jack led a training exercise with his No. 2 Commando in Inveraray, which is a town in Scotland.</p>
